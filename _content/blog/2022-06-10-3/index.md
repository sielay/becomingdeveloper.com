It all depends on the case, but you can use such rules of thumb:

 * JavaScript - most versatile
 * Python - heavily calculations
 * PHP - wide web legacy
 * Ruby - big in the US
 * Java/C# - corporate

Check what's popular in your area and industry. Pick one language and after you learn it, it will be easier to move from one to another.
